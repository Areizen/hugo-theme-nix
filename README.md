# Nix

Nix is a simple, minimal theme for Hugo

## Usage

Clone the repository to your hugo theme directory

```
mkdir themes
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nix
```

## Configuration

Add these parameters to your `config.toml`:

```
[params]
  GithubID = "your_github"
	TwitterID = "your_twitter"
	LinkedInID = "your_linkedin"
	GoogleplusID = "your_googleplus"
	FacebookID = "your_facebook"
	SelfName = "your_name"
	HeaderUsername = "username"
	HeaderHostname = "hostname"
	Email = "your_email"
	About = "info_about_you"
```

Edit them as needed. If you don't want one of the social networks simply delete that line. `HeaderUsername` and `HeaderHostname` will be displayed in navbar on left side in the format: `HeaderUsername@HeaderHostname ~ $`
